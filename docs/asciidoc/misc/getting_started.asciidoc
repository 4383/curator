Like a museum curator manages the exhibits and collections on display,
Elasticsearch Curator helps you curate, or manage your Elasticsearch indices.

Curator was first called
https://logstash.jira.com/browse/LOGSTASH-211[`clearESindices.py`].  Its sole
function was to delete indices. It was almost immediately renamed to
https://logstash.jira.com/browse/LOGSTASH-211[`logstash_index_cleaner.py`].
After a time it was briefly relocated under the
https://github.com/elastic/logstash[logstash] repository as
`expire_logs`, at which point it began to gain new functionality.  Soon
thereafter, Jordan Sissel was hired by Elastic (then still Elasticsearch), as
was the original author of Curator.  Not long after that it became Elasticsearch
Curator and is now hosted at https://github.com/elastic/curator

Curator now performs many operations on your Elasticsearch indices, from delete
to snapshot to shard allocation routing.
